# Experimental Rust read-only API client

This independent example is not the planned M6 SDK. It implements only the
`getNode` and `listDeployments` GET operations in the current
[OpenAPI document](../../docs/contracts/openapi.json); no other operation is
available. `NodeStatus` is a small typed projection, and deployment items are
returned as raw JSON. This is not a full OpenAPI schema validator. The crate is
a workspace member, using the repository's existing dependency lockfile and CI.

Construct `XeLabClient` with an exact `https://host[:port]` origin, a bearer
credential, a PEM CA certificate, and a positive timeout. Only the explicitly
supplied CA is trusted; certificate and hostname checks remain enabled. The
client refuses redirects, limits response bodies to 4 MiB, and never retries.
`list_deployments` returns one page; pass `next_cursor` back with the same
account and query scope, before it expires. Limits are 1–200 and cursors are
1–2048 characters, as in OpenAPI.

HTTP errors retain the status and, when valid JSON is returned, the standard
`ErrorEnvelope`. Non-JSON or malformed error bodies are not exposed. Transport,
timeout, invalid response, and oversized response are distinct. Formatting a
`ClientError` omits server-controlled error details; callers that explicitly
inspect those details should handle them as potentially sensitive data.

To try `getNode`, set `XELAB_API_ORIGIN`, `XELAB_API_CA_FILE` (a PEM CA file),
and `XELAB_API_TOKEN` through a secure local mechanism, then run:

```sh
cargo run --manifest-path examples/rust-api-client/Cargo.toml --locked --example read_node
```

The example prints only the numeric revision and admission state. Do not put
credentials in command arguments, source files, logs, or shell history. The
credential still needs permission for `getNode`; this example does not obtain,
refresh, or persist credentials.

From the repository root, component checks are:

```sh
cargo test --manifest-path examples/rust-api-client/Cargo.toml --locked --all-targets
cargo fmt --manifest-path examples/rust-api-client/Cargo.toml -- --check
cargo clippy --manifest-path examples/rust-api-client/Cargo.toml --locked --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

The tests use local HTTP/TLS fixtures and test credentials. They do not start a
real XeLab kernel, prove production authentication or complete M6 acceptance.
